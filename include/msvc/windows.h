/* 1600 is Visual C++ 2010, untested with C++ 2008

   if users include windows.h and winsock2.h in the wrong
   order, things go wrong: windows.h includes winsock.h
   with the old API, and winsock2.h will define the new API
   even if the old API is already defined, resulting in tons
   of redefinition errors.
   Defining _WINSOCKAPI_ ensures that winsock.h does not do
   anything.
   Without this define, pykde would not compile
